Pakistan has experienced a number of dengue fever outbreaks since 1992 and becoming most rapidly spreading mosquito,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
born,viral,disease,now,a,day.,In,present,study,prevalence,,of,dengue,fever,recorded,,from,"November,",2011,to,"May,",2012,,,,
Data,was,collected,,from,nine,towns,of,Lahore.,Results,,showed,that,total,"11,283",,dengue,cases,were,reported,in,different,,,,
hospitals,,of,nine,towns.,Highest,,prevalence,18.3%,,was,recorded,in,Data,GanjBaksh,,"town,",whereas,in,Gulberg,,and,Cant,,,
Town,was,recorded,,13.3%,and,,12.6%,respectively.,,The,prevalence,,in,Allama,Iqbal,and,Samanabad,,towns,was,found,,,,
11.9%,in,each.,The,least,affected,,area,was,Wahga,"Town,",where,1.5%,prevalence,,,was,recorded.,The,highest,prevalence,,,,,
of,dengue,fever,(DF),with,respect,,to,sex,was,observed,in,males,89%,(1192),in,Samanabad,,town.,The,DF,was,more,,,
prevalent,,in,females,of,Shalimar,,town,(35%).,The,prevalence,of,DF,with,respect,,to,age,in,age,group,21,to,30,years,was
found highest (23.14%) among,,,,,,all age groups. The possible reason for higher prevalence of dengue,,,,,,,,,,,,fever in,,males and in,,,,,
people,falling,,between,,21,to,30,years,of,age,can,be,attributed,to,the,fact,that,usually,these,people,spend,more,time,,
outdoors,,and,thus,have,more,chances,of,getting,affected.,,It,is,recommended,,that,keep,surroundings,of,congested,,areas,,,,
free from standing water. Potential breeding sites for mosquito needs to be inspected regularly.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
