## Data Visualization for Public Policy


##### This repository includes the work I have done in R and D3.js in creating static and interactive data visualizations for the crime rate of Lahore for early 2015. The crime rate of Lahore during that period increased, and, through these data visualizations, I explore different facets of the crime such as what types of crime occur when and where, what time periods register the highest rates of crime, and what is the impact of seasons on crime rate.

##### In each repo, you'll see a .html file (created through R Markdown). Please click on that file for a full set of visualizations in each folder.
